# Unofficial ABS' Resource Pack Repository
This is a repo for putting changes to [ABS' resource pack](http://tf2maps.net/thread/4674) in the time it takes for ABS to update it.

# Installing
This is assuming you have Hammer set up and have run it at least once, using the shortcut you got when you downloaded TF2.
Before installing, make sure you have run the uninstaller from the last stable version provided by ABS. See the thread above for more info.

1) Download [master.zip](/archive/master.zip)
2) Extract the contents of `UABS-Resource-Pack-master` to the root of your `SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2` folder, overwrite any files it asks about.
3) Launch `set_paths.bat` to adjust the paths in some of the downloaded files so hammer can operate properly.
4) Use hammer like you normally would, but with even more fixes and enhancements.
